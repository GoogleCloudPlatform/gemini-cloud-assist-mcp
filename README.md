This server connects [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) clients such as the [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) to the [**Gemini Cloud Assist APIs**](https://cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/api-and-reference). It allows you to use natural language to understand, manage, and troubleshoot your Google Cloud environment directly from the local command line.

> [!NOTE]
> The [Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service](https://cloud.google.com/terms/) and the [Data Processing and Security Terms](https://cloud.google.com/terms/data-processing-terms) do not apply to any component of the Gemini Cloud Assist MCP Server software.

To learn more about Gemini Cloud Assist, see the [Gemini Cloud Assist overview](https://cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/cloud-assist/) in the Google Cloud documentation.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Create and run investigations:** Create and run Cloud Assist investigations to find the root cause of complex issues.
- **Dig deeper and iterate on investigations:** Get more details about investigation outcomes and add observations to refine the analysis.
- **Find and analyze Google Cloud resources**: Quickly check the status and performance of your Cloud resources and applications.

## Get started

Before you begin, ensure you have the following set up:

- [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (v20 or later).
- [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- [**Google Cloud SDK**](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) installed and configured.
- A **Google Cloud project**.
- The following **IAM roles** on your user account:
  - `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin`: Required to enable the Cloud Assist APIs.
  - `roles/geminicloudassist.user`: Required to make requests to the Cloud Assist APIs.

### Step 1: Authenticate to Google Cloud

The Gemini Cloud Assist MCP server uses local Application Default Credentials (ADC) to securely authenticate to Google Cloud. To set up ADC, run the following `gcloud` commands:

```shell
# Authenticate your user account to the gcloud CLI
gcloud auth login

# Set up Application Default Credentials for the server.
# This allows the MCP server to securely make Google Cloud API calls on your behalf.
gcloud auth application-default login
```

### Step 2: Configure your MCP Client

Below is the standard configuration snippet you will use. It tells the client to use `npx` to download and run the latest version of the MCP server on demand. Paste the MCP configuration to an MCP client of your choosing. We recommend using the [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) for the best experience.

#### MCP config

```json
"mcpServers" : {
   "GeminiCloudAssist": {
     "command": "npx",
     "args": ["-y", "https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gemini-cloud-assist-mcp"]
   }
}
```

## Setup Instructions for MCP Clients

### Gemini CLI

#### Global Installation

Add the [MCP config](#mcp-config) to the **_\~/.gemini/settings.json_**. This would give you access to MCP Tools in every Gemini CLI session.

#### Project Level Installation

Add the [MCP config](#mcp-config) to your **_/path/to/project/.gemini/settings.json_** file. This would give you access to the MCP Tools in Gemini CLI sessions created under this project folder only.

#### Extension Installation

> [!WARNING]
> This uses an experimental Gemini CLI feature.

As an alternative to manually editing settings.json, you can install the server directly as a [Gemini CLI extension](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/blob/main/docs/extension.md):

```shell
gemini extensions add --source https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gemini-cloud-assist-mcp
```

If the above command errors, add the `extensionManagement` flag to your **\~/.gemini/settings.json**. This will give you access to the `gemini extensions add` subcommand to install Gemini CLI extensions directly from a github repository URI.

```json
{
  "mcpServers" : { "..." },
  "experimental": {
    "extensionManagement": true
  }
}
```

Validate successful installation by running:

```shell
gemini extensions list
```

 ╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

✦ The investigation is complete. Here's what I found:

  The main problem is that your GKE cluster `weather-front` is out of resources. It
  has only one node, and that node is full. This is causing new pods to get stuck in
  a "pending" state because there's no room for them.

  The investigation also revealed that Node Auto-Provisioning (NAP) is disabled. This
   is a key feature that allows the cluster to automatically add more nodes when it's
   running low on resources. Because NAP is disabled, the cluster can't scale up to
  meet the demand.

  I have two recommendations to fix this:
   1. Enable Node Auto-Provisioning for the weather-front cluster. This is the best
      long-term solution because it will allow the cluster to automatically scale up
      and down as needed.
   2. Manually add more nodes to the cluster. This is a good short-term solution that
       will immediately relieve the resource pressure and allow the pending pods to
      be scheduled.

  I recommend that you start by enabling Node Auto-Provisioning. I can do this for
  you now, or you can do it yourself by following the instructions in the official
  documentation (https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/node-auto-pro
  visioning#enable).

<summary>Dig deeper and iterate on investigations</summary>

```shell
✦ The investigation is complete. Here's a summary of the findings:

  Primary Cause:

   * Ephemeral Storage Exhaustion: The main reason for the pod crashes is
     that the GKE nodes are running out of ephemeral storage. This is
     causing a DiskPressure condition on the nodes, which in turn leads to
     the kubelet evicting pods to free up space.

 ╭───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
 │  > Do you know which pod is consuming all the storage space?                      │
 ╰───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

✦ That's a great question. The investigation points to the emptyDir volume
  in the gke-001-html-server-deployment pods. I can check the storage usage
  inside one of the running pods to confirm this.

  First, I'll list the pods to find one that is currently running.
 ╭───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
 │ ✔  Shell kubectl get pods -n gke-001-namespace (This command will list..          │
 ...                                                                                 |
 ...                                                                                 |
 ╰───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯


✦ That's unexpected. The /data directory in that pod is only using 4.0K,
  which is negligible. This contradicts the hypothesis that the emptyDir
  volume is the primary consumer of ephemeral storage.

  This means something else on the node is consuming the storage. It could
  be logs, or another process running on the node that isn't immediately
  obvious.

  To figure this out, I'll need to get a shell on the node itself and
  investigate the storage usage from there. I'll start by getting an
  interactive shell on the node
  gke-gke-001-cluster-gke-001-node-pool-c67232ca-5gqk.
 ╭───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮

 ...                                                                                 |

 ╰───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

✦ It seems I can't directly SSH into the node. This is likely due to
  firewall rules or the node not having an external IP address.

  However, I can still investigate the node's storage. I'll add an
  observation to the investigation, noting that the emptyDir volume is not
  the cause of the storage issue, and then re-run the investigation. This
  will allow Gemini to analyze the node's logs and other signals to
  pinpoint the true source of the storage consumption.

 ╰───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

✦ I've added the new information to the investigation. Now I'll re-run the
  analysis. This will take the new observation into account and should help
  us identify the real source of the storage consumption.

 ╰───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯


✦ The new investigation results are in.

  Key Findings:

   * `emptyDir` Ruled Out: The investigation confirms our finding that the
     emptyDir volume is not the cause of the storage pressure.
   * Container Logs are the Likely Culprit: The analysis strongly suggests
     that the ephemeral storage is being consumed by container logs. The
     kubelet is failing to reopen log files due to "no space left on
     device," which is a clear indicator of this issue.
   * Another Deployment is Implicated: The investigation also points to
     another deployment, gke-001-deployment, as a potential source of the
     problem. The logs mention that this deployment is "configured to fill
     up disk."
